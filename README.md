Nim solution to Advent of Code 2018.

This is my solutions to Advent of Code 2018 problems.

Using Nim to solve these problems is certainly the wrong choice if you want a quick solution. As a statically typed language, Nim lacks the flexibility of dynamic languages such as Python or Ruby. You have to declare your types, your variables and describe the parameters of your procedures, all things which take some time. So, if you use Nim, don’t expect to be among the best performers even if you are able to find the right algorithm very quickly (which is not my case). But I have great pleasure to write code in this elegant language. 

I didn’t want to compete with other people on the private leaderboard which is theoretically intended for Nim programmers. But, by solving each problem, I found myself in the top ten. Even if I will try to keep this place, I do not want to build quick and dirty solutions. And, anyway, before writing some code in Nim, its better to think at what you want to do.

Anyway, the rank in the Nim leaderboard is not really relevant as most of the best performers doesn’t use Nim.

Regarding my solutions, I generally write two separate programs for part 1 and part 2. It allows to keep each program clean with only the needed elements to solve the current problem. But, in some cases, I have merged the programs in a single one. Part 1 and part 2 are identified by the second number. When there are several version (generally the first I have written and a second one optimized), they are identified by a letter and the preferred version has the letter ‘a’.
