Nim solutions to Advent of Code 2018.

These are my solutions to Advent of Code 2018 problems.

Using Nim to solve these problems is certainly the wrong choice if you want to find a solution quickly. As a statically typed language, Nim lacks the flexibility of dynamic languages such as Python or Ruby. You have to declare your types, your variables and specify the type of the parameters of your procedures, all things which take some time. So, if you use Nim, don’t expect to be among the best performers even if you are able to find the right algorithm very quickly (which is not my case). But you can have great pleasure to write code in this elegant language.

Regarding my solutions, I generally write two separate programs for part 1 and part 2. It allows to keep each program clean with only the needed elements to solve the current problem. But, in some cases, I have merged the programs in a single one. Part 1 and part 2 are identified by the second number. When there are several versions (generally the first I have written and a second one optimized), they are identified by a letter and the preferred version has the letter ‘a’.
